In this video I will show you how to salvage and test 18650 lithium-ion cells. All these batteries are taken from old leftover laptops.  
To be a perfect salvage 18650/11865 Battery:  
1) Voltage should be higher than 1.5V DC before 1st charge.  
2) Should not get warm while charging.   
3) if the initial voltage (before charge) lower than 1.5V DC that battery will be dead or less in charging capacity.  
4) After 6-7days of 1st charge voltage should not be drop drastically. Ex: 3.8V to 1.3V without use.  
5) Check the real capacity of the Li-ion cell using a professional charger/Discharger.  
6) Maximum charge voltage should be nearly 3.9V-4.2V DC.
